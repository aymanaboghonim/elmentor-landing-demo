# i18n Guidelines — Elmentor Landing

Purpose: Document the initial auto-translate + manual QA process for Arabic support.

## Files & Layout
- `i18n/en.json` — English canonical copy
- `i18n/ar.json` — Arabic copy (initially machine-translated; updated over time)

## Auto-translation Workflow (MVP)
1. Export string resources from `i18n/en.json` in a stable key/value format.
2. Run an automated translation tool that produces `i18n/ar.json` from the English strings. Save the output in the repo and prefix the commit with `i18n: auto-translate - TODO: QA`.
3. Add the resulting commit to the editorial backlog using label `i18n-review`.
4. In CI, run a lightweight validation that ensures `i18n/ar.json` is valid JSON and that all keys exist (no missing keys). CI will not fail on machine-translated content but will mark it as un-reviewed.

## Editorial Manual QA Workflow
- A native speaker or translation editor issues a PR to update `i18n/ar.json` with corrected translations.
- Every editorial PR must include a `QA note:` in the description explaining the changes and context.
- Changes from editorial PRs are required before marking the translation as canonical.

## Fallback & Logging
- The application MUST fall back to `en.json` for any missing keys in `i18n/ar.json`.
- Record missing translation keys in a simple text log at `tools/i18n/missing-keys.log` or similar; expose them to the editorial backlog automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria for Translation
- The language toggle switches to Arabic and displays translated content; fallback to English for missing items.
- Editorial PRs exist with `i18n-review` label for every auto-translated batch.
- No critical CTA or legal copy should be left auto-translated without explicit editorial approval before final release.

## Tips
- Keep strings short and contextual. Avoid embedding variables in long sentences.
- Use split date/number formats appropriate for Arabic.
- Maintain a simple glossary for brand names, program names, and common phrases.
